•

Escape masks are mandatory in plant operating areas. These masks will be given by
HSE to all the contractor workers at the entering of plant after orientation.
These masks will be given back to HSE at the end of TA execution. For proper
arrangement the workflow is as follows:
o Contractors’ EPCL supervisor will coordinate with HSE representative for their
workers at least 2 days before entering to plant site via email mentioning the
count of workers.
o HSE will arrange the orientation of these workers and their escape masks will
be given to their supervisors. Their supervisors will be accountable for proper
issuance of Escape masks to their workers before entering the plant site
throughout TA-24. These masks will be the responsibility of workers’ EPCL
supervisors. After execution of TA-24 these escape masks will be given back to

Use of splash goggles is mandatory in specified areas / activities (e.g., dikes, etc.)
which are marked.
Use of safety harness is mandatory in a condition or situation which could result in a
fall from an elevated position where handrail / mid rail system is not present. As a
guideline, safety harness is required five feet above grade level except when working
on proper scaffolding or permanent work platforms.

The contractor is responsible for procuring PPEs in
accordance with the EPCL approved PPEs brand list.
Prior to usage, the contractor must formally request
approval for the selected PPEs from the respective
section.
These PPEs will then be routed to the HSE
department for thorough inspection & testing.
Following the inspection & testing process, HSE will
either approve or reject the PPEs based on EPCL
compliance and safety standards.
5.7. Safety Talk and Contractor Responsibilities
•

•
•

All safety facilitators, organized by the contractor for various jobs, must undergo
comprehensive training provided by the contractor concerning EPCL safety systems.
They are required to obtain certification for the role of "Contractor Safety Supervisor /
Facilitator" from EPCL Safety Section, based on both written and verbal screening
processes.
It is mandatory to conduct a safety talk before commencing any job. Prior to the
initiation of field work on any project, a safety briefing will be conducted.
During this briefing, EPCL representatives such as Project Engineers, Process
Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Production Supervisors, Mechanical Supervisors,
